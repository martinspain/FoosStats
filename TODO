It is a good idea. Each player can have a no. of games/power index, giving an indication of which players are generating the most power.

Do you think each match should have an extra stat.... number of times the ball leaves the table. This could be used to calculate the “power factor”

We’ve already got most of the profile pages written, courtesy of Jim:

Also Ryan needs to find a way of showing if you win in 2 or 3 games, and counting 2 out of 3 as an aggregate win – that’s what really counts.

I’d also like to see a historical position table like this:

And probably a profile page like this:

Actually... just build football manager

I think all this should be do-able by Monday.

I’m going to make Ryan add a new feature to the site, where you can choose any two players and see head-to-head stats.

I think it should show two sections, firstly each player’s general foos stats, and then the players’ record against each other (if they have played opposite each other before).

Here is my proposal for the stats, please chip in if you think any are missing or could be improved:


General Stats:

Total Wins
Total Losses
Win/Loss Ratio
Longest Winning Streak
Longest Losing Streak
Number of goals scored when in attack
Number of goals conceded when in defence
Most popular team mate (who you have played with most often)
Most popular opponent (who you have played against often)

Player vs Player stats:

Number of wins against other player
Number of losses against other player
Number of goals scored when in attack against other player
Number of goals conceded when in defence against other player

I’m thinking the bottom four should be displayed as a bar, like the bottom of this picture:
